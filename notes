structure of the db file.


status
- id_status
- minmax
- minmax action
- maxmin
- maxmin action # in the 1-100 game, if minmax is assigned (meaning the opponent will play next), then maxmin is not assigned. and vice versa. But i keep both.

lt
- id_status
- id_action
- new_status

lto
- id_status
- id_action
- new_status

#idx id_status on 3 tables.






stateme lt maxmin
stateoppponent lt minmax

for each, my points

test with that, based on the fact that i take the max for the stateopponent (the state before mine).


test with maybe first to say 3 when picking number between 1 and 2, hopefully that won't be too much trees. Simulate that with dir names and file that represent minmax.
or in ascii art maybe.

play = 1,2
win = 4

o0,maxmin=1
	m1, a1, minmax=1
		o2, a1, maxmin=1
			m3, a1, minmax=-1
				o4, a1, p=-1
			m4, a2, p=1
		o3, a2, maxmin=1
			m4, a1, p=1

	m2, a2, minmax=-1
		o3, a1, maxmin=1
			m4, a1, p=1
		o4, a2, p=-1
		

tables :
my_state(state, maxmin, maxaction)
opp_state(state, maxmin, maxaction)

path(old_state, new_state, opponent) if opponent=True, then old_state is mine, new_state is opponent. It's the opponent turn.
